        <strong>Description</strong><br />
        THE INTERNATIONAL BESTSELLER We all have an ikigai. It's the Japanese
        word for 'a reason to live' or 'a reason to jump out of bed in the
        morning'. It's the place where your needs, desires, ambitions, and
        satisfaction meet. A place of balance. Small wonder that finding your
        ikigai is closely linked to living longer. Finding your ikigai is easier
        than you might think.
